Genetic Algorithm for Conway's Game of Life

This project implements a genetic algorithm to evolve patterns in Conway's Game of Life. The GUI, built with PyQt5, visualizes the evolutionary process as patterns develop over generations.

Features

Genetic Algorithm: Uses selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve patterns.

PyQt5 GUI: Provides a real-time visualization of the evolving generations.

Customizable Parameters: Adjust population size, mutation rate, and number of generations.

Fitness Evaluation: Scores patterns based on predefined criteria.

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/genetic-game-of-life.git
cd genetic-game-of-life

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Run the main script to start the GUI:

python main.py

Configuration

Modify config.py to adjust genetic algorithm parameters.

Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Please ensure code follows the project's style and include tests where necessary.
